<h4>This is an Web-Application which allows user to store their confidential files securely in the blockchain.</h4>

 <h2>Why BlockChain?</h2>
   <h4>The solution to make cloud storage faster and more secure is using blockchain. Blockchain is a database or ledger that is shared across a network. This ledger is encrypted such that only authorized parties can access the data. Since the data is shared, the records cannot be tampered.</h4>

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
<h3>1. React JS</h3>
<h3>2. Solidity for smart contracts</h3>
<h3>3. Ganache & Metamask</h3>
<h3>4. IPFS</h3>
<h3>5. Ethereum Blockchain is backend for the application where files get stored</h3>
